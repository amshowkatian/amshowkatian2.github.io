My name is Aliah, and I'm a student at George Mason University. I'm studying English with 
a concentration in literature, with a minor in Spanish. I also wanted to minor in an 
interdisciplinary program GMU offers called Digital Media and Web Design, but I 
unfortunately won't be able to without taking a certain number of prerequisites. But, I
still wanted to get experience in graphic design, UX, and now, coding, because I enjoy it
and wanted to have the skills. That's why I'm currently taking this summer class--ENGH 
375: Web Authorship and Design, which is my reason for making this website. Please, take 
a look around this rudimentary website to learn a bit more about me.
