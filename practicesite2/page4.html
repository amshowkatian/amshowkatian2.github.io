I've included a sample of my academic work here. This paper was produced as a result of a 
class I took in fall 2020 called Green Worlds in the English Renaissance (ENGH 421). A 
version of it was accepted to be presented as the only undergraduate student work at the 
American Comparative Literature Association's annual conference in 2021, sponsored by the 
seminar, <i> Re-centering "Peripheral" Literature in Utopia. </i>

<h4> The Abolition of Human Emotions through Philosophical Principles in Thomas 
More’s “Utopia” </h4>
<p>
Cities, though often romanticized as gleaming structures of metal, characterized by 
dynamic cultures and citizens, can be stripped bare to be nothing but bustling hubs 
filled with rubbish, rats, and people packed into apartments they break their backs over 
to be able to afford.  Societies, likewise, are imperfect creations, and while humankind 
knows there is little that can be done to construct a tangible, unblemished city or 
culture, there is an abundance of fictional places that have been invented to cure ills 
and solve our problems without creating new ones. In Sir Thomas More’s <i>Utopia</i>, such a 
“no-place” is conjured with the intent of showing human beings what a perfect, chimeric 
country might look like; one where all the citizens happily conform to established 
societal ideals, one where slavery is not condemned, but overwhelmingly appreciated—
including by the slaves themselves—and one where an epicurean mindset prevails in the 
quest to seek individualistic happiness. <i>Utopia’s</i> second book includes a section on the 
island’s residents’ personal philosophies, but it is not until the reader reaches a 
passage on “religious principles” (pp. 87) that More begins to reveal the unviability 
of his new design. The importance of the attainment of virtue is emphasized above all 
else, but it is achieved in a radical new way, where an individual must focus on their 
own pleasure rather than inflicting self-harm or denial, and remove all sadness and 
unhappiness from their life. Because this idealized pleasure results in the elimination 
of basic human emotions, More’s concept that human beings would be able to exist solely 
on happiness and goodness renders his entire fictional society an impossibility.
</p>
<p>
The Utopians’ complex definition of virtue maintains that an individual’s “only care 
would be to keep a lesser pleasure from standing in the way of a greater one, and to 
avoid pleasures that are inevitably followed by pain” (pp. 87). “Pleasure,” here, is 
described to be “good and honest,” and does not involve deeds performed with a hedonistic 
mindset, such as alcohol and drug abuse. One should not fall into the trap of self-harm 
and torment in order to please God, but should help oneself as much as one is instructed 
to be kind and aid others, Utopians believe. Elements of this theory are admirable, and 
can be seen in application in modern day concepts: if an airplane begins an unforeseen 
and dangerous descent and passengers are provided with emergency oxygen systems, it is 
standard procedure to have everyone secure masks on their own person before attempting 
to assist another. 
</p>
<p>
However, components of this ideology are frightening, as Raphael reports that the Utopians 
believe we should “relieve the misery of others and, by removing sadness from their lives, 
restore them to enjoyment…” (pp. 88). Here, reasonable argument is abandoned, and the book 
instead begins to enter the realm of an impossible, utopian—or even dystopian—society. 
With the quote’s declaration, it is suggested that an essential part of what defines 
human beings—sadness—is worthless, and as long as it exists, an individual cannot truly 
partake in the religious values and attainment of virtue that Utopian society idealizes. 
Even animals who have intense familial bonds experience sadness, though, not to the extent 
a human being does. Our ability to feel emotions is so intense that we can channel them 
into other mediums, such as art, writing, music—many masterpieces have come into being 
from the hands of tormented souls. It is what makes us so deeply human. 
</p>
<p>
The human character is warped by distancing the reader from the average Utopian citizen, 
and though all of the island’s traditions and customs are known to us, there is not a 
single place in Book II (not even in the passage that is the focus of this essay) where a 
Utopian character is introduced and presented to the reader. These philosophies use 
nothing but blank faces as their models. The amelioration of previously unsolvable 
economic issues with the cooperation of servile, non-humanlike characters is demonstrated 
through the way the number of people in a typical Utopian household is managed. If a 
household contains more or less of the required number of adults (between ten and 
sixteen), the situation is almost instantaneously remedied with the addition or 
subtraction of however many adults are necessary. The author then moves on, without 
blinking an eye at the impracticality and sheer contrariety of the proposition. “They do 
not, of course, try to regulate the number of minor children in a family” (pp. 78), 
whether or not citizens might want to leave their family, though, is not mentioned or 
considered. 
</p>
<p>
This is either an extreme oversight on More’s part, or, more likely, a purposeful effort
 to emphasize the fact that being forced to abandon one’s family would not be a major 
 occurrence in Utopia, nor one that someone should dedicate too much time and energy 
 thinking about, because “the second rule of nature is to lead a life free from anxiety 
 and as full of joy as possible” (pp. 87). This example is consistent with the 
 philosophies analyzed in pages 87 and 88: to excessively dwell on one’s unfortunate 
 circumstances in life leaves little to no room for the pursuit of happiness and the 
 achievement of the virtue that is so idealized. 
 </p>
 <p>
 Religious beliefs that encourage self-harm are used to propose that there are only two 
 paths one can take to reach this philosophical and virtuous goal, furthering the message 
 that there is no room for varied human emotion in Utopia. The standard pious person in 
 More’s time was certainly different than what we might consider a dedicated worshiper 
 today. Denial of individual desires was prominent in Christian traditions, so a culture 
 that not only allowed, but encouraged the exploration of personal (but “good and honest”) 
 pleasures must have been both groundbreaking and tempting to readers. Using acidulous 
 phrasing such as “the <b>most hard-faced eulogist</b> of virtue and the <b>grimmest enemy </b>
 of pleasure, while they invite us to <b>toil</b> and <b>sleepless nights </b> and <b> self-laceration</b>…” 
 (pp. 87), the author is convincing when trying to pull readers from the common practice 
 of bodily mortification. The operative words draw from the bleakest elements of 
 contemporaneous beliefs and contrast them with a relatively peaceful and oneiric society 
 that does not even consider pursuing “harsh and painful virtue” and giving “up the 
 pleasures of life.” These two prominent moral standards—harsh vs. gentle—appear as 
 black-or-white, rather than ambiguous; More writes that the Utopians believe “a joyful 
 life (that is, one of pleasure) is a good thing, or it isn’t.” Can a joyful life not be 
 in between these two options? A joyful life, such as the one More describes, is hardly 
 one a modern reader would want to live, nor is an unjoyful one. He is indefatigable 
 while using his claims about the importance of the removal of sadness to entice a reader 
 to embrace Utopian ideals rather than valuing the power of ambiguity in emotions.
 </p>
 <p>
 Instead of presenting the harmful characteristics of temptation and self-indulgence as 
 the major enemies to the Utopian way of life, they are hardly considered in this 
 scenario. Whether or not Utopians are exposed to the overconsumption of alcohol that 
 has been common for millennia, or consistent self-gratification in the way of sex or 
 drugs is unknown, but we know for certain that the luxury and decadence that accompanies
the valuing of gold and jewels is something that has been entirely wiped out in Utopia, 
and is an outlandish concept. Therefore, this is instantly ruled out as a means through 
which they might attain pleasure and virtue, “and the reason is that men whose minds are 
filled with false ideas of pleasure have no room left for true and genuine delight” 
(pp. 88). Riches have never been a temptation, but something that borders on the 
despicably foreign. Instead, the concept that is portrayed to be the most alluring, and 
that it is necessary to be rid of, is genuine unhappiness that plagues the lives of so 
many. In stating that human beings should “relieve the misery of others, and by removing 
sadness from their lives, restore them to enjoyment” (pp. 87), More endorses the notion 
that individuals should follow the same procedure: purge themselves of depression, end 
expatiating on misfortune, and simply be happy. 
</p>
<p>
Here, the idea of ridding oneself of a basic human emotion—ignoring how difficult, and 
perhaps, impossible, this would be—is not just entertained, but advocated for. Sadness 
becomes the enemy, the temptation, despite its complexity being one of the very things 
that allows humanity to define itself separately from other species on this Earth. 
Raphael tells his listeners that to prevent “devotees of this false pleasure,” who 
“strut about, and put on airs,” (pp. 89) devaluing gold, jewels, fine clothes, and other 
riches is necessary to achieve a utopian society. It may be improbable that we reach a 
time when jewels are cast away like pebbles covered in mud, but certainly not unachievable, 
as humans are not born with the instinct to prize them so highly. But to suggest that a 
mother would feel no sadness and would not protest at the very thought of her child (even 
if s/he were legally an adult) having to leave her household simply because of an imbalance 
in numbers would be to attempt to change the very essence of human nature. 
</p>
<p>
Despite the condemnation of self-denial and laceration that More inserts into this passage,
 he proposes something equally insufferable: that we (attempt) to abandon more disagreeable 
 emotions in favor of the pleasant ones, all in the hopes that it might bring some peace 
 and stability to the human race. If these dogmatic, religious principles put forth in the 
 passage are so valued in Utopian life, are such an ideal that citizens strive to achieve, 
 they do nothing but confirm that More’s <i>Utopia</i> can never be anything but impossible and 
 fictitious, as it aims to betray innate human emotions and qualities.
